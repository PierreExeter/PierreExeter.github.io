This Tableau dashboard explores the churn rate of customers for a subscription-based business model. The visualisations helped discovering the following insights :
- The churn rate dramatically increased for new users when the monthly charges are high.
- As customers stayed with the company longer, they were less likely to churn as prices increased.

The business recommendations are:
- to bring on new clients at a lower price point and to slowly increase time over time for a better ROI
- to convert monthly customers to yearly or 2 years contracts with incentive.
