## Project


This project showcases a Dockerized service for serving a regression model and monitoring its performance in production. The core components include:
- A **Flask REST API** that serves model predictions through endpoints.
- A **monitoring system** that generates new sample data and logs [data drift](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/understanding-data-drift-model-drift) and [concept drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift) metrics.
- A **Grafana** dashboard for visualizing these metrics in real-time.
- An **alert pipeline** that triggers notifications to a Discord channel whenever monitored metrics exceed a threshold value.
- A containerized application (**Docker** and **Docker Compose**) for consistent deployment.
